I am a final-year PhD student in Machine Learning at Imperial College London, supervised by [Yingzhen Li](http://yingzhenli.net/home/en/). I obtained my MPhil degree in Machine Learning and Machine Intelligence from the University of Cambridge in 2020, supervised by [José Miguel Hernández-Lobato](https://jmhl.org/). Before that, I graduated with a BSc (Hons) in Mathematics and Statistics from McMaster University. 

During my PhD, I mainly work on uncertainty quantification, robustness in large-scale deep sequence models, and generative models. In general, I am also interested in probabilistic continual learning and meta-learning. I aim to develop reliable algorithms with improved calibration, generalization, and robustness.

From August to December 2024, I worked on continual learning as a research intern in the [Approximate Bayesian Inference team](https://team-approx-bayes.github.io/) at [RIKEN AIP](https://aip.riken.jp) in Tokyo with [Mohammad Emtiyaz Khan](https://emtiyaz.github.io). From June to November 2023, I worked as a research intern in the Responsible AI team at [ByteDance Research](https://www.bytedance.com/) in London, where I researched on machine learning fairness.
